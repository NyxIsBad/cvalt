GitLab is now being replaced by GitHub, so this repo is now deprecated.

Please replace the import at the top of your theme
`@import url(https://clearvision.gitlab.io/v6/main.css);`
with 
`@import url(https://clearvision.github.io/ClearVision-v6/main.css);`

If your background or home icon also is not showing up due to them being hosted on our github, you can also replace the background with `url(https://clearvision.github.io/images/sapphire.jpg);` and the home icon line `url(https://clearvision.github.io/icons/discord.svg);`... or just customize them
