# cvalt
An updated version of the clearvision main import for those living in countries where gitlab is blocked. I manually update a local copy of clearvision every time it updates and build it locally, as github refuses to support pull mirroring

To use this alternate import, replace the main import at the top of your theme file
`@import url(https://clearvision.gitlab.io/v6/main.css);`
with 
`@import url(https://nyxisbad.github.io/cvalt/main.css);`

You will also have to replace the background image with `url(https://nyxisbad.github.io/cvalt/sapphire.jpg);` (or a custom image of your choice)
and the home icon line `url(https://nyxisbad.github.io/cvalt/discord.svg);`
